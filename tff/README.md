# federated_training with tff

- We will create a simple federated program and will run it over simulation
- Next we will try to take the same program to production


## 1. Simulation:

Simulations are sun on my [custom built workstation](##Workstation Specs)

## 2. Production:

- My [custom built workstation](##Workstation Specs) is used as server
- My [Rasberry Pi](##Device Specs) board is used as server


## 3. Testing scalability on public cloud provider:

GCP is selected as public cloud provider for this study


## Workstation Specs
